## ⚠️ About <a name = "about"></a>

Terabyte Tweaker is an program that optimizes your Windows PC, allowing it to run faster and smoother.

I strongly recommend you to use this app in your low end desktop computer, as it will give you an extra FPS boost to your PC, at the moment, im focused in making Minecraft's FPS higher, and in the tests that i've peformed, my FPS practically tripled, it went from 60 to 180 FPS (can vary from PC to PC).
Most tweaks may not be reccomended in high end computers but feel free to try, if you desire to remove the app afterwards then refer to [Uninstalling](#uninstalling).

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
### 🛑 Prerequisites

This application works on both Windows 10 and 11, I have not tested it in lower versions, and i do **NOT** recommend using it on them, as it may cause damage to the system when tweaking Regedit.
Even though all my regedit tweaks are harmless, I do not want any chance of damage to your system, so don't come crying to me if your Windows Vista got problems after using it.

**Warning: For the app to run, you NEED to have a connection to the internet.**

Also, [here](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/ec0bba5208ca4e036b4820f30205e2011cf0b07f9050ef635ecf0a295692e329?nocache=1) is the VirusTotal report:

I plan to remake this app in another programming language, but im still studying rust, so it will take a while.
I tested this app **piece by piece** on my computers and didn't need to use VMs, beacuse none of the features are able to damage your system.
