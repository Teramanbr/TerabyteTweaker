I strongly recommend you to use this app in your desktop computer, as it will give you an extra FPS boost to your PC, at the moment, im focused in making Minecraft's FPS higher, and in the tests that i've peformed, my FPS practically tripled, it went from 60 to 180 FPS (can vary from PC to PC).

This application works on both Windows 10 and 11, i have not tested it in lower versions, and i do **NOT** recommend using it on them, as it may cause damage to the system when tweaking Regedit.
Even though all my regedit tweaks are harmless, i do not want any chance of damage to your system, so don't come crying to me if your Windows Vista got problems after using it.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Microsoft SmartScreen

Running downloaded Batch files triggers a [Microsoft SmartScreen](https://docs.microsoft.com/pt-br/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-smartscreen/microsoft-defender-smartscreen-overview) prompt, even if the Batch file is not a security threat.
To proof even more that my program is not a virus, [here](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/94a84cf4cea2ed8d8a39a6d568379f63729a00a2a1119427c848cd68cdcbe601?nocache=1) is the VirusTotal report:

To contact me directly, send me a message on my discord: Teraman_br#5060
I plan to remake this app in another programming language, but im still studying rust, so it will take a while.
I tested this app **piece by piece** on my computers and didn't need to use VMs, beacuse none of the features are able to damage your system.
